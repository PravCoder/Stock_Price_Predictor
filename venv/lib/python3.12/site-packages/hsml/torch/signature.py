    !!! note "Lazy"
        This method is lazy and does not persist any metadata or uploads model artifacts in the
        model registry on its own. To save the model object and the model artifacts, call the `save()` method with a
        local file path to the directory containing the model artifacts.

    # Arguments
        name: Name of the model to create.
        version: Optionally version of the model to create, defaults to `None` and
            will create the model with incremented version from the last
            version in the model registry.
        metrics: Optionally a dictionary with model evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, MAE)
        description: Optionally a string describing the model, defaults to empty string
            `""`.
        input_example: Optionally an input example that represents a single input for the model, defaults to `None`.
        model_schema: Optionally a model schema for the model inputs and/or outputs.

    # Returns
        `Model`. The model metadata object.
