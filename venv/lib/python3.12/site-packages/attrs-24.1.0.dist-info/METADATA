*attrs* is the Python package that will bring back the **joy** of **writing classes** by relieving you from the drudgery of implementing object protocols (aka [dunder methods](https://www.attrs.org/en/latest/glossary.html#term-dunder-methods)).
[Trusted by NASA](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/personalizing-your-profile#list-of-qualifying-repositories-for-mars-2020-helicopter-contributor-achievement) for Mars missions since 2020!

Its main goal is to help you to write **concise** and **correct** software without slowing down your code.


## Sponsors

*attrs* would not be possible without our [amazing sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/hynek).
Especially those generously supporting us at the *The Organization* tier and higher:

## Example

*attrs* gives you a class decorator and a way to declaratively define the attributes on that class:

<!-- code-begin -->

```pycon
>>> from attrs import asdict, define, make_class, Factory

>>> @define
... class SomeClass:
...     a_number: int = 42
...     list_of_numbers: list[int] = Factory(list)
...
...     def hard_math(self, another_number):
...         return self.a_number + sum(self.list_of_numbers) * another_number


>>> sc = SomeClass(1, [1, 2, 3])
>>> sc
SomeClass(a_number=1, list_of_numbers=[1, 2, 3])

>>> sc.hard_math(3)
19
>>> sc == SomeClass(1, [1, 2, 3])
True
>>> sc != SomeClass(2, [3, 2, 1])
True

>>> asdict(sc)
{'a_number': 1, 'list_of_numbers': [1, 2, 3]}

>>> SomeClass()
SomeClass(a_number=42, list_of_numbers=[])

>>> C = make_class("C", ["a", "b"])
>>> C("foo", "bar")
C(a='foo', b='bar')
```

After *declaring* your attributes, *attrs* gives you:

- a concise and explicit overview of the class's attributes,
- a nice human-readable `__repr__`,
- equality-checking methods,
- an initializer,
- and much more,

*without* writing dull boilerplate code again and again and *without* runtime performance penalties.

---

This example uses *attrs*'s modern APIs that have been introduced in version 20.1.0, and the *attrs* package import name that has been added in version 21.3.0.
The classic APIs (`@attr.s`, `attr.ib`, plus their serious-business aliases) and the `attr` package import name will remain **indefinitely**.

Check out [*On The Core API Names*](https://www.attrs.org/en/latest/names.html) for an in-depth explanation!


### Hate Type Annotations!?

No problem!
Types are entirely **optional** with *attrs*.
Simply assign `attrs.field()` to the attributes instead of annotating them with types:

```python
from attrs import define, field

@define
class SomeClass:
    a_number = field(default=42)
    list_of_numbers = field(factory=list)
```


## Data Classes

On the tin, *attrs* might remind you of `dataclasses` (and indeed, `dataclasses` [are a descendant](https://hynek.me/articles/import-attrs/) of *attrs*).
In practice it does a lot more and is more flexible.
For instance, it allows you to define [special handling of NumPy arrays for equality checks](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/comparison.html#customization), allows more ways to [plug into the initialization process](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/init.html#hooking-yourself-into-initialization), has a replacement for `__init_subclass__`, and allows for stepping through the generated methods using a debugger.

For more details, please refer to our [comparison page](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/why.html#data-classes), but generally speaking, we are more likely to commit crimes against nature to make things work that one would expect to work, but that are quite complicated in practice.

## Release Information

### Backwards-incompatible Changes

- `attrs.evolve()` doesn't accept the *inst* argument as a keyword argument anymore.
  Pass it as the first positional argument instead.
  [#1264](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1264)
- `attrs.validators.provides()` has been removed.
  The removed code is available as a [gist](https://gist.github.com/hynek/9eaaaeb659808f3519870dfa16d2b6b2) for convenient copy and pasting.
  [#1265](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1265)
- All packaging metadata except from `__version__` and `__version_info__` has been removed from the `attr` and `attrs` modules (for example, `attrs.__url__`).

  Please use [`importlib.metadata`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.metadata.html) or [*importlib_metadata*](https://pypi.org/project/importlib-metadata/) instead.
  [#1268](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1268)
- Speed up the generated `__eq__` methods significantly by generating a chain of attribute comparisons instead of constructing and comparing tuples.
  This change arguably makes the behavior more correct,
  but changes it if an attribute compares equal by identity but not value, like `float('nan')`.
  [#1310](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1310)


### Deprecations

- The *repr_ns* argument to `attr.s` is now deprecated.
  It was a workaround for nested classes in Python 2 and is pointless in Python 3.
  [#1263](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1263)
- The *hash* argument to `@attr.s`, `@attrs.define`, and `make_class()` is now deprecated in favor of *unsafe_hash*, as defined by PEP 681.
  [#1323](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1323)


### Changes

- Allow original slotted `functools.cached_property` classes to be cleaned by garbage collection.
  Allow `super()` calls in slotted cached properties.
  [#1221](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1221)
- Our type stubs now use modern type notation and are organized such that VS Code's quick-fix prefers the `attrs` namespace.
  [#1234](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1234)
- Preserve `AttributeError` raised by properties of slotted classes with `functools.cached_properties`.
  [#1253](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1253)
- It is now possible to wrap a converter into an `attrs.Converter` and get the current instance and/or the current field definition passed into the converter callable.

  Note that this is not supported by any type checker, yet.
  [#1267](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1267)
- `attrs.make_class()` now populates the `__annotations__` dict of the generated class, so that `attrs.resolve_types()` can resolve them.
  [#1285](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1285)
- Added the `attrs.validators.or_()` validator.
  [#1303](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1303)
- The combination of a `__attrs_pre_init__` that takes arguments, a kw-only field, and a default on that field does not crash anymore.
  [#1319](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1319)
- `attrs.validators.in_()` now transforms certain unhashable options to tuples to keep the field hashable.

  This allows fields that use this validator to be used with, for example, `attrs.filters.include()`.
  [#1320](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1320)
- If a class has an *inherited* method called `__attrs_init_subclass__`, it is now called once the class is done assembling.

  This is a replacement for Python's `__init_subclass__` and useful for registering classes, and similar.
  [#1321](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1321)
