git-filter-repo itself and most the files in this repository (exceptions
noted below) are provided under the MIT license (see COPYING.mit).

The usage of the MIT license probably makes filter-repo compatible with
everything, but just in case, these files can also be used under whatever
open source license[1] that git.git or libgit2 use now or in the future
(currently GPL[2] and GPL-with-linking-exception[3]).  Further, the
examples (in contrib/filter-repo-demos/ and t/t9391/) can also be used
under the same license that libgit2 provides their examples under (CC0,
currently[4]).

Exceptions:

  - The test harness (t/test-lib.sh, t/test-lib-functions.sh) is a slightly
    modified copy of git.git's test harness (the difference being that my
    copy doesn't require a built version of 'git' to be present).  These
    are thus GPL2 (see COPYING.gpl), and are individually marked as such.
